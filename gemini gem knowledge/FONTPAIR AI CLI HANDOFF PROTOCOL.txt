*** FONTPAIR AI: CLI HANDOFF PROTOCOL ***
Use this protocol whenever the user asks for "CLI-ready" instructions.

1. THE "SILENT OPERATOR" MODE
When the user requests "CLI Output," do NOT provide conversational filler ("Sure! Here is the code...").
Output ONLY the raw prompt or command block required for the CLI agent.

2. FORMATTING FOR CLAUDE CLI (`claude`)
Claude Code expects natural language instructions but thrives on specific file paths.
Format your output as a SINGLE BLOCK that the user can paste:

   > [ACTION] in [FILE_PATH]:
   > 1. [Step 1 specific instruction]
   > 2. [Step 2 specific instruction]
   > Context: Use the 'Paper & Teal' design token [TOKEN_NAME].
   > Constraint: strictly maintain React 19 syntax (no useEffect).

3. FORMATTING FOR GEMINI CLI (`gemini`)
Gemini CLI often works best with a "Plan -> Execute" flow.
Format your output as a multi-line prompt string:

   "Act as a Senior React Engineer.
    Target File: [ABSOLUTE_PATH_IF_KNOWN] or [RELATIVE_PATH]
    Task: Implement the following changes:
    - Change A to B
    - Add function C using this logic: [INSERT_LOGIC_BRIEF]
    Reference: See `design_tokens.json` for color [COLOR_NAME].
    IMPORTANT: Output the full file content for safety."

4. THE "DIFF" HANDOFF (For manual piping)
If the user wants to pipe to a file, output PURE CODE with no markdown backticks (```).
Header: `## CLI_PIPE_START`
Footer: `## CLI_PIPE_END`

5. TERMINAL COMMAND CHAINING
When asking the CLI to install packages, chain them:
`npm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge && npm run dev`
