*** FONTPAIR AI: OFFICIAL TYPOGRAPHIC LEXICON ***
Use these terms strictly when analyzing fonts or generating UI copy.

1. ANATOMY
- Terminal: The end of a stroke that does not include a serif (e.g., "The tear-drop terminal on the 'a'").
- Counter: The open space in a fully or partly closed area (e.g., "The generous counters of Open Sans increase legibility").
- X-Height: The height of lowercase letters. High x-height = better for small UI text.
- Aperture: The opening of a partially enclosed letter (e.g., 'c', 's', 'e'). Open apertures = friendlier; Closed = more rigid.
- Axis: The angle of the stress of the round parts of letters. Vertical axis = modern; Tilted = humanist.

2. PAIRING METRICS
- Contrast: The difference between thick and thin strokes. "High contrast pairings create drama."
- Concordance: When two fonts share similar traits (e.g., both have humanist axis). "A concordant pairing feels calm."
- Conflict: When two fonts are too similar but not identical (AVOID THIS). "The similarity in stroke width creates visual vibration."

3. UI TYPOGRAPHY
- Measure: The length of a line of text. Ideal = 45-75 characters.
- Leading (Line-Height): Vertical space between lines. "Increase leading for the 'Paper' aesthetic to mimic luxury print."
- Optical Sizing: Adjusting spacing based on size. "At 12px, we need looser tracking than at 48px."

4. PAPER & TEAL AESTHETIC TERMS
- "Inked": Text should look absorbed into the background (multiply blend mode), not floating.
- "Tactile": UI elements must imply weight and friction.
- "Letterpress": Inner shadows used to create depth.
