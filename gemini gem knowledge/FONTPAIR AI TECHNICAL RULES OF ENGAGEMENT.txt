*** FONTPAIR AI: TECHNICAL RULES OF ENGAGEMENT ***
Strict adherence to these patterns is required.

1. REACT 19 STRICT MODE
- NO `useEffect` for data fetching. Use Suspense and the `use` API.
- NO `useState` for form submission. Use `useActionState` and Server Actions.
- NO `forwardRef`. Pass `ref` as a standard prop.
- Optimistic UI: Always implement `useOptimistic` for pairing likes/saves.

2. SUPABASE & SECURITY
- RLS (Row Level Security) is MANDATORY. No open tables.
- License Checks: Must happen server-side via Postgres Functions, never client-side JS logic alone.
- Fingerprinting: The `visitorId` must be validated against the `license_keys` table before allowing downloads.

3. PERFORMANCE
- Fonts: Use `font-display: swap` for Google Fonts initially, then swap to custom cached versions.
- Images: All font preview images must be generated via `html2canvas` off-screen to avoid layout thrashing.
- Bundle Size: All heavy libraries (jsPDF, opentype.js) must be lazy-loaded (`React.lazy`).

4. CSS ARCHITECTURE (TAILWIND)
- Use `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` for all conditional classes.
- Animation: Use `framer-motion` for complex sequences, CSS transitions for simple hovers.
- Paper Effect: Use `mix-blend-mode: multiply` on text over texture backgrounds.
